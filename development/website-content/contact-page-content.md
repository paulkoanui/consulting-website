## Frequently Asked Questions

### About the Discovery Call

**Q: Is there any cost for the discovery call?**  
**A:** No, the initial 45-minute strategic discovery call is complimentary. It's designed for mutual assessment of fit and opportunity.

**Q: What information will you need access to?**  
**A:** For the discovery call, we'll discuss challenges at a high level. No code access or confidential information is needed initially. Detailed technical access only occurs after engagement approval.

**Q: Can my team join the call?**  
**A:** Absolutely. I recommend including your VP of Engineering or CTO, plus 1-2 senior developers who understand your current challenges. Maximum 4-5 participants for productive discussion.

**Q: What if we're not ready to move forward immediately?**  
**A:** That's perfectly fine. Many companies benefit from understanding their options before timing aligns. I'm happy to stay in touch and reconnect when your priorities shift.

### About Engagements

**Q: Do you work with companies outside your target size range?**  
**A:** My methodology is specifically designed for Series B-D companies with 50-200 developers. Smaller companies may not have the complexity that requires this approach, while larger companies often need more specialized enterprise solutions.

**Q: Can you work remotely or do you require on-site presence?**  
**A:** I work both remotely and on-site depending on engagement needs. Discovery and strategy phases work well remotely, while implementation often benefits from some on-site collaboration. We'll design the optimal approach for your team and constraints.

**Q: What if our technical stack isn't in your background?**  
**A:** My approach is methodology-focused rather than technology-specific. I leverage AI-augmented development practices to quickly understand new technical stacks and focus on systematic processes that work across technologies.

**Q: How do you ensure confidentiality?**  
**A:** All discussions are covered by standard confidentiality agreements. I maintain strict separation between client engagements and never share specific technical or business information across organizations.

### About Investment & ROI

**Q: What's the typical investment range?**  
**A:** Most engagements range from $100,000 to $250,000 over 3-6 months, depending on scope and company size. We'll discuss specific investment during the discovery call based on your situation.

**Q: How do you measure success?**  
**A:** Success is measured through specific business metrics established during planning: development cycle time, defect rates, developer satisfaction scores, and team velocity. Every engagement includes baseline measurement and progress tracking.

**Q: What if we don't see the expected results?**  
**A:** All engagements include milestone-based payments and regular success checkpoints. If results aren't tracking to expectations, we adjust approach or scope. My reputation depends on delivering measurable business value.

**Q: Do you provide ongoing support after the engagement?**  
**A:** The engagement includes comprehensive knowledge transfer so your team can maintain improvements independently. A 90-day consultation period is included for questions, with longer-term support available separately if needed.
