## Problem Statement Section
**Headline:** The Scaling Wall Every Growing SaaS Company Hits

Growing companies face predictable technical challenges:
- **Legacy systems** that worked at 10 developers don't scale to 100
- **Technical debt** accumulates faster than teams can address it  
- **Developer velocity** slows just when market demands acceleration
- **Documentation gaps** and process inconsistencies create bottlenecks
- **Traditional consulting** focuses on technology, not business outcomes

**Result:** Engineering teams work harder but deliver slower, while competitors gain ground.

## Solution Section

**3. Proposal & Planning**  
Clear implementation plan with measurable success criteria and business impact projections.

**4. Implementation**

**5. Measurement & Handoff**  
Sustainable processes with quantified results and team capability to maintain momentum.
